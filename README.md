# RADAR SIMULATIONS

> This is just a hobby project am developing in my leisure time to quench my curiosity. Its about various types of RADARs and Electronic Warfare technologies. Just doing my part to understand existing concepts and explore newer ones.

> The code will be distributed among various branches of this Repository.

> The objective is to analyse the short comings and ways to either mitigate them (which usually involves using a newer type of RADAR) or stratergies to avoid detection (Electronic Warfare)

This branch will be a simple simulation for an **Omni-directional RADAR**.

### Results

![OmniRadar](./results/omniradar.gif)

### Disadvantages

- It is not possible to deduce the direction using this RADAR
Only distances can be calculated.
- An Electronic warfare equipment simply emitting Radio waves in the same frequency will be able to confuse this type of RADAR

> Note : Here the speed of Radio waves is slowed down in severals orders of magnitude. Thus the red reflecting dot that moves faster than the radio waves themselves itself is an impossible condition. Thus the case, where the radio waves reflected from the object when nearby to source reaching the source earlier than the reflected waves that are far away will never occur.
