# RADAR SIMULATIONS

> This is just a hobby project am developing in my leisure time to quench my curiosity. Its about various types of RADARs and Electronic Warfare technologies. Just doing my part to understand existing concepts and explore newer ones.

> The code will be distributed among various branches of this Repository.

> The objective is to analyse the short comings and ways to either mitigate them (which usually involves using a newer type of RADAR) or stratergies to avoid detection (Electronic Warfare)

This branch will be a simple simulation for an **Omni-directional RADAR**.
